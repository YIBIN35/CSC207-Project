# GESTUREBRIDGE ‚Äî‚Äî HUMAN CONNECTION FOR ALL üëãüåâ

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**GestureBridge** is a groundbreaking **sign language translation application** that leverages machine learning to create seamless communication between individuals who use sign language and those who don't. This innovative platform captures ASL sign language gestures through a camera, interprets them, converts them into written text, and vocalizes that text‚Äîoffering a **real-time, accessible communication experience**.

At its core, GestureBridge is more a bridge to fostering **greater inclusivity and understanding** between communities. By breaking down communication barriers, we hope to empower individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as their families, friends, and colleagues. We believe that **human connection** is the foundation of any thriving society, and our mission is to help people connect through language, regardless of the medium they use. ü§ùüí¨

The platform will initially support ASL fingerspelling, with plans to extend vocabulary and functionality over time. GestureBridge will continually evolve to offer better, more accurate sign language recognition and translation, creating a more inclusive environment for all

## GESTUREBRIDGE MANIFESTO
At **GestureBridge**, we don‚Äôt just create software‚Äîwe create **connections**. Our mission is to build a world where **language is no barrier** to understanding, communication, and human connection. We believe that **language**‚Äîwhether spoken, written, or gestured‚Äîshould empower people to share ideas, thoughts, and emotions without limitations. 

By using **GestureBridge**, you're not just accessing a tool‚Äîyou're contributing to **a future where inclusivity, empathy, and understanding are the foundation** of all interactions. Together, we aim to create a more **accessible world** where **everyone is heard**, and **everyone belongs**, no matter how they communicate. üåçüí¨

## FEATURES
- **Real-Time Sign Language Recognition** ü§ñ: GestureBridge can instantly recognize sign language via your webcam feed, allowing seamless interaction. Currently, the application supports fingerspelling, with plans to incorporate more gestures in future updates.
  
```
    public void startRecognition() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        predictor.startRecognition(this::predictionToPresenter);
    }
    private void predictionToPresenter(String prediction) {
        SignLanguageRecognitionOutputData outputData = new SignLanguageRecognitionOutputData(prediction);
        signLanguagePresenter.updateView(outputData);
    }
```

- **Multilingual Language Translation** üåê: Recognized signs are translated into multiple languages, broadening communication between individuals across linguistic divides.
  
```
    String translatedText = languageDataAccessObject.translate(language, text);
    SignLanguageTranslationOutputData signLanguageTranslationOutputData =
        new SignLanguageTranslationOutputData(translatedText);
    signLanguageTranslationPresenter.prepareSuccessView(signLanguageTranslationOutputData);
```

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion** üîä: GestureBridge vocalizes the recognized text in real-time, allowing for spoken communication.

```
    TextToSpeechOutputData outputData = textToSpeechService.convertTextToSpeech(inputData);
    outputBoundary.prepareOutput(outputData);
```

- **Voice Customization üé§**: Users can personalize the speech output by adjusting voice type, pitch, speed, and volume, making the interaction feel more natural, and respecting the identities of the users.

```
    voiceSettingsDataAccessObject.changeSettings(audioSettings);

    final CustomizeVoiceOutputData customizeVoiceOutputData = new CustomizeVoiceOutputData(audioSettings, false);
    voiceSettingsPresenter.prepareSuccessView(customizeVoiceOutputData);
```

- **Speech-to-Text Transcription** üìù: Voice input from the other individual is transcribed into text, displayed for the deaf or hard of hearing person.

```
    public void processSpeech(SpeechToTextInputData inputData) throws Exception {
        String onSpeechRecognition = speechRecognizer.recognize(inputData.getAudioData());
        SpeechToTextOutputData outputData = new SpeechToTextOutputData(onSpeechRecognition);
        speechToTextPresenter.deliverTranscription(outputData);
    }
