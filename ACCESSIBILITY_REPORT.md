# Project Accessibility Report

### 1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle.

#### Equitable Use
- The app has a text to speech feature for those who have vision disabilities.
- The app has a speech to text feature for those who have hearing disabilities.
- Sign language compatability is built into the app.

#### Flexibility in Use
- The text to speech feature can be edited to change preferred voice type, speed and pitch.
- The buttons on the app light up when hovered over, making it easy to know what is going to be pressed.
- The user is able to choose from 4 languages to translate transcriptions to.

#### Simple and Intuitive Use
- Each button works with one click, so the entry to use is very low
- The text to speech speed can be adjusted according to the speed the user is comfortable with.
- Each piece of information (the webcam, sign-language translation, and voice transcription) are clearly displayed in
  their own spaces.

#### Perceptible Information
- The app has both visual and verbal output for the user.
- The colours are chosen to give contrast between text and backgrounds.
- Buttons have different text and colour to differentiate them.

#### Tolerance for Error
- The languages for translations is displayed as a drop-down menu with set languages instead of a text box as to not
  work with a language the app doesn't function with.
- The sliders for text to speech customization are set to not go past the TTS secret_configuration's boundaries.
- Speech to text transcription has a start and stop button so the app doesn't record unwanted/irrelevant audio.

#### Low Physical Effort
- Use cases can be accessed with only the click of a button, no need for overly tedious navigation.
- The buttons on the app are large so someone with low motor skills can still click on them easily.
- Buttons are placed next to each other in order to minimize the movement from button to button.

#### Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Buttons stand out clearly from the background, so they are easily visible.
- Components in the text to speech settings view are close together and easily accessible.
- Sliders in the text to speech settings can be clicked on to move in increments of one if it's easier for the user.

### 2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers.
Our main demographic would be people with hearing disabilities since GestureBridge is an app designed mainly around sign
language translation. These people could use this app to communicate with those who don't know sign language. It even
has the possibility of being used in special education classrooms for kids who have trouble hearing.

Another demographic we would market ourselves towards would be people who are learning another language. Since
GestureBridge includes a translation feature, it could help language-learners learn new vocabulary. The text to speech
feature would also be useful for them, since it could help with pronunciation of certain words. Especially since the
user is able to set the TTS speed to make it easier to understand for them.

### 3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
Our program may be less likely to be used by certain demographics, particularly those with disabilities who do not communicate through the English fingerspelling system. As outlined in the embedded ethics module, this could reflect a limitation of the social model of disability. The program currently addresses some social limitations for users with disabilities, but its focus on fingerspelling English letters may exclude individuals who use other sign languages, such as British Sign Language or Auslan. In this case, the program fails to remove the personal and social limitations faced by users of these other sign languages, as it is designed with a particular impairment in mind but does not account for the diversity of communication needs. Moreover, people who do not interact with disabled individuals regularly may not find the program useful, as they may not see a direct need to address potential barriers for disabled users. This reflects the broader idea that universal design should aim to include as many users as possible, regardless of disability, and in this case, the program may not fully align with that principle
